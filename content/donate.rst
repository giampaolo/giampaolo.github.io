I spend a lot of time working on my OSS projects, especially `psutil`_. I've been doing this for free for over 13 years now, because I genuinely enjoyed doing it (and I still do). psutil got very widespread though, way more than I expected. This has become hardly sustainable for me in terms of time. I'm trying to sustain its development via a funding mechanism.
