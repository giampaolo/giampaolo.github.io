I spend a lot of time working on my OSS projects, especially `psutil`_. I've been doing this for free for over 13 years now, because I genuinely enjoyed doing it (and I still do). psutil got very widespread though, way more than I expected. This has become hardly sustainable for me in terms of time. I'm trying to sustain its development via a funding mechanism.

The funding
===========

* **$5**, **$10**, **$25 / month**: you'll get your name/avatar displayed in psutil's `README <https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil#supporters>`__ (GitHub), `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/psutil>`__ web page and `gmpy.dev/supporters <https://gmpy.dev/supporters>`__.

* **$50 / month**: same as above + if the `master` branch is in a stable state and contains a bugfix you care about, you can ask me to **publish a new release**. If you do, I'll have to be 100% confident that `master` is in a good state and ready for release. Usually I fix bugs on master, then I wait 3-4 months before creating a new release.

* **$100 / month**: I will display your company logo in psutil's `README <https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil#supporters>`__ (GitHub), `documentation <https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/psutil>`__ web page and `gmpy.dev/supporters <https://gmpy.dev/supporters>`__.
* **$150 / month**: company logo + you can ask me to publish a new release
